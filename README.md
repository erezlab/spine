Spatial Proximity in Images for Network Exploration

The goal of this project is to construct a representation of a social network in a manner similar to the <a href="http://aidenlab.org/juicebox/">Hi-C method</a> for 3D genomic architecture analysis.

The idea is as follows:

1. Access tagged images from an image repository (e.g. facebook)
2. Construct frequency counts for appearance of individuals in the same images
3. Create a matrix plot of the frequency counts connecting individuals found in the same images
4. (Optional) Organize the matrix to reveal architectural principles within your network
